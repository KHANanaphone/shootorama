IF THE GAME IS LAGGING AT THE START, TRY REFRESHING IT. I HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT WHY THIS HAPPENS YET.

Top-down room-based shooter game with keys and stuff. Still sort of winging it as I go.

--------

Movement: WASD or arrow keys
Shoot: I or Z
Dash: ) or X
Strafe: Hold P or C

4/26/2015
- Ghosts no longer turn instantly, instead they will gradually turn
- New visual effects for stunned/confused ghosts
- Now there are variants of ghosts
- Room transitions
- You no longer need to hold a direction while dashing
- Fixed 'dashing through wall' bug (but it'll be back)

4/21/2015
- The 'dodge' system is now in. If the enemy dashes at you, and you dash out of the way so that they hit your green 'image' that you leave behind, it will trigger. The enemy will be left confused, and your color will change. Your next shot will be 'empowered' and deal extra damage. Shoot the confused enemy to stun it.
- Also, as the enemy begins their dash, they will flash red. Counterattack during that time to stun the enemy. Mashing won't work, will only work if they have no 'ring' around them.
- Added a bunch more visual effects
- Next up: room transitions, figure out how to handle room data.
